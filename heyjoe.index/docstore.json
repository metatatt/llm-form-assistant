You will register on-line by providing the following information:\r\n\r\nOne of the following: Employer Identification Number (EIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or Organization Number\r\nContact Name\r\nCompany Name\r\nAddress\r\nCity\r\nState\r\nZip Code\r\nCountry\r\nTelephone\r\nFax\r\nE-mail","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["30",{"pageContent":"One of the following: Employer Identification Number (EIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or Organization Number\r\nContact Name\r\nCompany Name\r\nAddress\r\nCity\r\nState\r\nZip Code\r\nCountry\r\nTelephone\r\nFax\r\nE-mail\r\nEIN numbers are required for U.S. firms, and DUNS numbers are required for foreign firms. You will need to have an EIN or DUNS number to create a User Fee account and proceed with registration. If you have previously registered with the FDA User Fee System for an ADUFA or PDUFA cover sheet, you will have been issued an Organization ID number (Org ID). The Org ID uniquely identifies your organization to the FDA. You will need one of these three numbers to proceed with registration.\r\n\r\n2. Fill out the Medical Device User Fee Cover Sheet.

In contrast to a work request, where an employee submits a request to management to perform a task, a work order is generated when maintenance work is requested by management. There are several types of requests for different situations:\r\n\r\nEmergency maintenance\r\nInspections\r\nGeneral work order","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":9}}}}],["87",{"pageContent":"Emergency maintenance\r\nInspections\r\nGeneral work order\r\nUsed to facilitate effective communication between departments, a work order provides a paper or virtual trail for all aspects of the work to be performed.

A work order will generate the invoice number required to link all the processes required for a repair.\r\n\r\nThe work order document contains all the information needed to properly initiate and invoice the service.

This makes it a handy tool for employees to quickly determine their responsibilities, as well as for accounting purposes.
